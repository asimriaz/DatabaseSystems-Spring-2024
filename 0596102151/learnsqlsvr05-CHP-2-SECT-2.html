                <p class="docText">In relational database terminology, a table is called a <I>relation</I>, and is
                    denoted by the name of the relation followed by the columns (or attributes), as shown here:</p>
                <pre>
Dependent(pno, dname, relationship, sex, age)
</pre><br>

                <p class="docText">An instance of a relation is a row of a relation (table) with values. We will use the
                    term "row" to refer to a line of output. Although database literature also uses the term "tuple" or
                    "record" in place of row, we will most often use the word "row," because "row" is more commonly used
                    in relational databases (and SQL Server is a relational database).</p>
                <p class="docText">In the previous section, we showed you how to select or display particular columns
                    from a table, but we did not explain how to select or display specific rows. Usually you would want
                    to select or display only particular rows from a table. For example, you may want to list all the
                    dependents who are older than five, or list all the dependents who are female. In such a case, you
                    want only the rows <tt>WHERE</tt> the dependents are older than five, or, only the rows
                    <tt>WHERE</tt> the dependents are female. That is, you want to display only the rows that meet a
                    certain condition or criteria.</P>
                <p class="docText">By using a <tt>WHERE</tt> clause in a <tt>SELECT</tt> statement, you can selectively
                    choose rows that you wish to display based on a criterion. For additional filtering, the
                    <tt>WHERE</tt> clause can be used with logical operators like <tt>AND</tt> and <tt>OR</tt>, and the
                    <tt>BETWEEN</tt> operator and its negation, <tt>NOT BETWEEN</tt>.</P>

                <H4 id="title-IDAOV0S5" class="docSection2Title">2.2.1. Filtering with WHERE</H4>
                <p class="docText">The <tt>WHERE</tt> clause is a row filter that is used to restrict the output of rows

                    <a name="IDX-CHP-2-0090"></a>
                    ) in a result set. When the <tt>WHERE</tt> clause is used, the SQL Server database engine selects
                    the rows from the table for the result set that meet the conditions listed in the <tt>WHERE</tt>
                    clause. So, as we have previously illustrated, if no <tt>WHERE</tt> clause is used in a query, the
                    query will return all rows from the table.

                <p class="docText">Following is the general syntax of a <tt>SELECT</tt> statement with a <tt>WHERE</tt>

                <p class="docText">So far we have shown you how to include only one condition in your <tt>WHERE</tt>
                    clause. If you want to include multiple conditions in your <tt>WHERE</tt> clause, you can use
                    logical operators like <tt>AND</tt> and <tt>OR</tt>, and other operators like <tt>BETWEEN</tt> and
                    its negation, <tt>NOT BETWEEN</tt>. The following sections discuss and illustrate the use of the

                <p class="docText">As we will often point out, SQL statements may be written in several ways. For

                <p class="docText">The <tt>BETWEEN</tt> operator can be negated by using the keyword <tt>NOT</tt> before
                    the <tt>BETWEEN</tt> operator. <tt>NOT BETWEEN</tt> allows you to determine whether a value does not
                    occur within a given range of values. The general syntax of the <tt>NOT BETWEEN</tt> is:</p>
                <pre>
SELECT...
FROM
WHERE
NOT BETWEEN value1 AND value2
</pre><BR>

                <p class="docText">For example, if we want to find all the dependents who are not between the ages of 3
                    and 15, we would type the following:</P>

SELECT dname, age

NOT BETWEEN 3 AND 15
