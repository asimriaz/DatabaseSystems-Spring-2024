                    organizations as well as by database and IT professionals who are actively working with SQL Server .
                </P>
                <p class="docText">The book starts with very simple SQL concepts, and slowly builds into more complex
                    query development. The purpose of this book is to present every topic, concept, and idea with
                    examples of code and output. Exercises have also been included to gain SQL proficiency using SQL
                    Server. The best approach to using this book efficiently is to read through the book with SQL Server
                    open and active. As the book is read, it will be advantageous for you to work with and understand
                    the examples.</P>
                <p class="docText">If the book is used for a beginning database course, the exercises are presented to
                    be done by the students over the course of one semester at a pace of one chapter per week. The
                    exercises are found at the end of each chapter.</p>
                <p class="docText">Due to the dramatic increase in the popularity of relational and multiuser databases,
                    many schools and training organizations are using SQL Server in their database courses to teach
                    database principles and concepts. This development has generated a need for a concise book on SQL
                    Server programming, tied in with database principles and conceptshence this book.</p>
